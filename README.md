Windows has restrictions on customization,

so you must download and use Wallpaper Engine or Rainmeter.

And you have to make app.

## (in a playful tone)

**IT'S THE GREATE TOP BAR.**

eh? Isn't that great? that's so sad...

And I didn't include public folders.

## I said

It does not include public folders.

```
%FLUFFIT_ROOT%
└┬ public
 └┬ icons
  ├┬ app
  │├─ 64x64.png
  │├─ 192x192.png
  │└─ icon.ico
  └─ assets ー https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/tree/master/assets
```
