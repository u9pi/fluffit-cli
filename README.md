# Fluffit

Windows has restrictions on customization,

so you must download and use Wallpaper Engine or Rainmeter.

And you have to make app.

## (in a playful tone)

So, I want to make a better application.

**IT'S THE GREATE TOP BAR.**

eh? Isn't that great? that's so sad...

And I didn't include public folders.

## I said

It does not include public folders.

## Installation

_it's really simple_

follow below:

1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. and also [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Open a windows terminal
```javascript
Just press Windows(⊞) and X,
(on other OS, Meta or Super)
then I or A.
/* A means Administrator. */
```
4. write the code below
```bash
git clone https://github.com/u9pi/fluffit-cli.git
